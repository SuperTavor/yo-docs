# Useful functions for event crafting
**original guide by @z_u_ra on discord**


Events are super-powerful! You can create cinematic text interactions, but there are a few things you should know.

To make talking possible in the event, type the following:
```php
$local1 = StartTalkEvent();
```
To talk all text from a specific text section in your event text file, do the following
```php
$local1 = EventTalkRun(unhashed text section ID);
```

Finally, to close the talking section in your event, you can do

```php
$local1 = EndTalkEvent();
```
Also, a pro tip: if you want bustups to appear in your event, add the following function call for your model ID:
```php
$local1 = BustupAssign(model id, -1, -1);
```
