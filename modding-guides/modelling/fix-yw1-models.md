# How to Fix Models to Work on Yo-kai Watch 1S/M
**Original guide by @heartyalexii on discord**

## How to port New Models in YKW1 HD


Step 1. 
Get the model you want to put in, Whether it be a port, or a custom one made with Level5BlenderAddon

Step 2. 
Get an HD(Switch/Mobile) Model (this can be any model from the HD files) and extract a .xi and the .sil

Step 3. 
Save all textures (png resource not xi) from the .XI's located in your custom/new model.

Step 4. 
In Kuriimu2, on your custom models tab, replace all the .xi's with the ones exported from the HD model.

Step 5. 
Replace the .SIL in your custom model with the .SIL in the HD Model

Step 6. 
Now that you have copied the .XI's from the HD Model into your custom model, change the textures (the png resource not the XI itself) of the new .XI's back to what it was. You should have saved these in step 3.

Step 7. 
Save the .xc and put it over the character you want to replace

Step 8. 
Save your mod, and use the appropriate mod installation method for your platform(SMT for Mobile, RomFS for Switch)
